# react-weather-app
Weather app in React with data from the OpenWeatherMap API

# To view in browser (on localhost):
In the react-weather-app folder: <br>
npm i <br>
npm run dev <br>

The user needs to create a .env file and have their own API-key to the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api "WeatherAPI - OpenWeatherMap") for the app to work as intended.
